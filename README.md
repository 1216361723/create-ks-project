# Create Ks App

Heavily inspired by create-next-app and create-react-app. This CLI tool can help you quickly setting up a ks plugin project.
You don't need to install or configure tools like webpack, Babel, TypeScript, etc. Just run the command and your project will be ready to go.

## Usage

```
yarn create ks-app my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` in the current directory.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the dependencies.
